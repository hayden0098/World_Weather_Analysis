# World_Weather_Analysis

## Review:
In this project of analysis, we use analysis, visualization, and statistical skills, API data retrieval by retrieving and analyzing weather data and map data from OpenWeatherMap and Google API for a travel company, PlanMyTrip. Successfully completing the tasks will be using Python, decision and repetition statements, data structures, Pandas, Matplotlib, and SciPy statistics. At the end the code be able to use input statements from the beta tester to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. From the list of potential travel destinations, the beta tester will choose four cities to create a travel itinerary. Finally, using the Google Maps Directions API, you will create a travel route between the four cities as well as a marker layer map.
